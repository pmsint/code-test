# PMS International Web Developer Code Test

## Brief

Using the Companies House public API (https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/api/docs/index.html), create a small app using your choice of PHP/Javascript that takes a user input for a company number, validates this input, then uses the API to verify whether the company is currently active, and whether it has any history of insolvency.

If the company is not active, return a message to the user refusing a credit account application, if the company is active but has a history of insolvency return a risk score (between 1-100) establishing how high the risk of issuing a credit account might be.

## Notes

The test should take no longer than 4 hours. We are not necessarily expecting a completed app, rather are looking at your approach and methodology.

Development practices should adhere to best practice, including usage of version control (commit early and often), hosted with github, and at least one automated test.

The git repository should be shared with user @pmsint on github, and should include a readme file containing build and run instructions and a brief overview of any assumptions you made when developing your app or the risk score.
